**Q: What are the pre-requisites for running HiveSchool?<br>**
A: Hiveschool requires the school use Google Apps Domain, because it leverages the existing Apps Domain credentials for students and teachers. Most schools that use the Google Education Ecosystem will have Apps Domain. Also, a full Chrome browser has to be installed on the student and teacher computers.<br>

**Q: What is the best way to distribute and install HiveSchool on student computers? <br>**
A: We recommend the Chromebook Management Console (a Google product).<br>

**Q: HiveSchool is a Chrome Extension - are there any specific requirements for the Wi-Fi network?<br>**
A: HiveSchool runs in a Chrome browser. As such, it has no ties to the underlying Wi-Fi network. It can be deployed with any modern, commercial-grade Wi-Fi network, independent of the vendor/brand.<br>

**Q: How does HiveSchool compare to classroom management applications like Hapara or LanSchool?<br>**
A: In a nutshell, HiveSchool is a lean connected learning application, as opposed to a full-fledged classroom management app. HiveSchool focuses on working with students in class – presenting content, keeping students on task and assigning teaching resources. We see these as they key features used in connected learning in the digital classroom.<br>
As a result, HiveSchool has a short learning curve for teachers and students, and is easy-to adopt. In addition, HiveSchool is free. As a result, it is a great choice for schools that want are looking for a core feature set, that want to quickly get started with connected learning apps, or just try them out.<br>

**Q: How does HiveSchool compare to the “iOS in Education” solution?<br>**
A: Hiveschool itself is similar to Apple’s new Classroom application, in that it allows assignment of teaching resources, viewing student screens and locking students to selected resources. HiveSchool has a few additional control features (remote closing of bowser tabs and closing all open tabs on login). Other differences:<br>
  * The Education solution seems to mostly work with apps, while HiveSchool works with online resources (Internet or school network). 
  * iOS in Education works on iPads, while HIveSchool works on Chromebooks of any brand, plus Macbooks and Windows computers.

**Other components of the iOS in Education solution include: <br>**
  * Apple School Manager. In the Google Education Ecosystem, the Chromebook Management Console for is used for MDM of Chromebooks. 
  * Managed Apple IDs. HiveSchool leverages the existing teacher and student credentials from Google Apps Domain.
  * Shared iPads for students. Student computers running HiveSchool can (and always could) be easily shared – as one student logs out, another logs in with their Apps Domain credentials. Once logged in, students have all HiveSchool and other Apps Domain content available. <br>


**Q: Do other Wi-Fi vendors have classroom applications or similar products?<br>**
A: Meraki is promoting their System Manager for use in classrooms, together with SAML integration (for authentication) and single app mode. It requires schools to purchase the required Meraki products (obviously) and states support only for iOS which restricts it to use with Apple mobile devices.
